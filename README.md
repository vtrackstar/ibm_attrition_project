# 🔍 Predicting Employee Attrition with Machine Learning
This portfolio project analyzes IBM’s fictional HR dataset to uncover the drivers of employee attrition and develop a predictive model. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven insights can support strategic HR decisions and reduce churn.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify top predictors of employee attrition using EDA and feature engineering.
- Compare multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Translate findings into actionable business recommendations for HR stakeholders.

## 📊 Key Takeaways
- **Top predictors:** Overtime, Job Role, and Distance from Home were consistently influential.
- **Model performance:** XGBoost achieved the best balance between precision and recall, especially for predicting the minority class (employees who left).
- **Recommendations:** Address overtime policy, monitor high-risk roles, and consider commute impact in retention efforts.

## 💼 Business Impact
- Understanding the "why" behind attrition helps organizations:
   - Proactively retain top talent
   - Improve employee engagement
   - Reduce replacement and onboarding costs

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook (exported as PDF for clean presentation)
