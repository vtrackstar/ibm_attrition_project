# 🔍 Predicting Employee Attrition with Machine Learning

This project explores employee attrition using IBM's fictional dataset. I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify key factors behind employee churn, and recommended actionable steps HR teams could take.

## 🚀 Goals
- Understand what factors drive attrition
- Test multiple classification models
- Provide actionable business recommendations

## 📈 Key Findings
- Overtime, Job Role, and Distance from Home strongly predict attrition.
- XGBoost achieved the best recall on the minority class.
- Recommendations include improving work-life balance and compensation for at-risk roles.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
